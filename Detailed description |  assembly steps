The following steps will explain how to assemble and what to check before running.

1.	GY-b11 280 barometric pressure sensor
* adjust buad rate to 115200.
* “begin” should be set to 0x76.
See https://www.xtronical.com/bmp280andesp32 for reference.
Regarding the baud rate and the begin-this depends on your type of sensor and may or may not be true depending on its quality. Try both if one is not working. 

2. The SHT3X Temperature and Relative humidity sensor code, along with WIFI and uploading to Thingspeak codes
can be found on https://agrotech-lab.github.io/code/2022/04/05/intro-to-sensor-modules-and-thingspeak.
The wiring is similar to the BMP280 in that it is I2C and is thus wired with SCL to I2C Clock (pin 22) and SDA to I2C Data (pin 21).
